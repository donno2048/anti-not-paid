# Developer is a smartass?

Your developer hid some code in your website because you didn't pay and now your webpage's opacity is decreased every day?

Add a piece of JavaScript to overcome his code.

## Usage

Add _ANP.js_ to your website and it won't fade out.

## Demo

View [demo.html](./demo.html) to see it in action.
